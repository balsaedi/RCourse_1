# R - Introduction
## R - Basic Concepts and applications 
**R (programming language)** is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics 

## Why R? 

1. **Developed by Statisticians** - R is Excellent for Statistical Computing and Analysis 
2. **Open-source (Free)** - R is an open-source programming language. Anyone can work with R without any license or fee. Due to this, R has a huge community that contributes to its environment. 
3. **A Large Variety of Specialized Libraries** - These libraries support and enhance the R development environment.
4. **R Studio** - A graphic user interface to R - easier to grasp and learn. 
5. **Cross-platform Support** - R is machine-independent. It supports the cross-platform operation. Thus, it is usable on many different operating systems.
6. **Can do Data Cleansing, Data Wrangling, and Web Scraping** - R can collect data from the internet through web scraping and other means. It can also perform data cleansing. R is also useful for data wrangling which is the process of converting raw data into the desired format for easier consumption. 
7. **Powerful Graphics** - R has extensive libraries that can produce production quality graphs and visualizations. 
8. **Compatible with other Programming Languages** - R is compatible with other languages like C, C++, and FORTRAN. Other languages like .NET, Java, Python can also directly manipulate objects.
9. Compatible with high performance computing and Big Data Analytics. 

## R studio
**Rstudio** is an integrated development environment(IDE) for R. 

It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution as well as tools for plotting history, debugging and work space management.

### R - Look and Feel

![](images/r-look-and-feel.png)

The image above is for R code in R Studio. Each quadrant has its own function. 
- text editor 

serves as the primary interface for writing and editing R scripts, Markdown documents, and other text-based files

- stand input/output (console/terminal/jobs)

It is the bottom left quadrant in R Studio that serves as a command-line interface where you can directly interact with R such as code execution and output display.

- all data and its properties quadrants 
It is the top right quadrant in Rstudio that is typically the "Environment" pane, which provides information and tools for managing your R environment such as data importation, display of variables. 


- plots and file directory structure
The bottom right quadrant in RStudio typically houses the "Files", "Plots", "Packages", "Help", and "Viewer" tabs. 

## Basic Mathematics like operators 
Addition - the `+` operator is used to add two or more values 
```{r}
2+3
```

Subtraction - the `-` operator is used to subtract two numerical values 
```{r}
6-2
```

## R Markdown 
R Markdown is a versatile markup language that allows you to create dynamic documents that integrate text, code, and output. It is widely used in data analysis, scientific research, and reporting

The figure shows how markdown looks like

Each chunk can be run separately in a single file, also the variable in one chunk can be reused by the next/later chunks 

Anything added outside the chuck will not be executed in the program

The R markdown can be knitted to a html, pdf, or word file and presented to the audience

## Installation of packages
R libraries/packages can be installed by invoking `install.packages("package_name")` to the console. The figure below shows how to install `expn` library.
