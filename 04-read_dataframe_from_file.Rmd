# Read a dataframe from a file
This chapter explains how to read a file to a data frame using the `readxl` library. The `readxl` package can be installed from the console by `install.packages("readxl")` command.

Lets begin by importing the library
```{r}
# Import the library
library(readxl)
```

The `readxl` library can read .xlsx, xls files to a data frame. For this case, Human genome excel file is read. 
```{r}
hg = read_excel("data/Human_genome.xlsx")
```

View the data 
```{r}
View(hg)
```
