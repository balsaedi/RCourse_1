# DATA TYPES AND DATA STRUCTURES

# 1. Solve the questions in R markdown;

## a. Create a the following variables as instructed below;

### i. a variable `length` to store `61.2`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#length = __

### ii. a variable `age` to store `76`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#age = __

### iii. a variable `is_old` to store `TRUE`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#is_old =

### iv. a variable `name` to store `"Pradip"`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#name = ____

### v. a variable `comp_var` to store `2 + 3i`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#comp_var = ______

## b. Use `class()` function to find the data type of the variables created above.
# FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE



## c. Create another variable `width` to store `12.1` and perform the following operations;
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#width = 

### i. Add variable `length` to width`. Let `length`` be `22.5`
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#length = ___
#___ + ____

### ii. Subtract `width` from `length`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#___ - ____

### iii. Multiply `length` and `width`. Store the solution in a variable `area`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#area = ____ * _____
#area

## d. Convert each of the created variable in "a" above to raw data type.

# 2. Create a vector, `my_vector` with the following values; `12, 54, 76, 71, 42, 75, 33` and perform the following operations; 
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#my_vector = c(__,__,___,__,__,__)

## a. Find the:
### i. dimension of `my_vector` using `dim()` function.
# FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE

### ii. data type of its element using the `class()` function. 
# FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE

### iii. Use the `is.vector()` function to find its a vector. 
# FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE

## b. This part will require you to access and manipulate the vector elements of `my_vector`. 

### i. Get the fourth value of `my_vector`. and print to the console. 
# FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE

### ii. Subset the vector from the second to the fifth element and print it to 
###  the console. 
# FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE

### iii. Exclude the fourth element and print the resultant vector to the console. 
# FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE

### iv. Reverse the order elements in `my_vector`. 
# FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE

# 3. Create two vectors; `vector1` and `vector2`that have the elements `12, 76, 45, 23, 64, 88` and `22, 87, 10, 5, 99, 54` respectively.Use the two vectors to answer the following questions. 
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
# vector1 = c(__,__,___)
# vector2 = c(__,__,___)

## a. Use `summarise()` function to find the descriptive statistics of`vector1`. 
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#summarise(____)

## b. Add 7 to `vector1` and name it `vector3`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#vector3 = _____ + 7
#vector3

## c. Subtract 3 from `vector2` and name it `vector4`. 
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
#vector4 = _____ - 3
#vector4

## d. Add `vector1` to `vector2`
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
# _____ + ______

## e. Find the division of the `vector1` and `vector2`.
# UNCOMMENT AND FILL THE CODE BELOW HERE
# _______ / ______
