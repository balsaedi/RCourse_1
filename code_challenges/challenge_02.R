# DATA TYPES AND DATA STRUCTURES

# 1. Solve the questions in R markdown;

## a. Create a the following variables as instructed below;

### i. a variable `length` to store `61.2`.
### ii. a variable `age` to store `76`.
### iii. a variable `is_old` to store `TRUE`.
### iv. a variable name to store `"Pradip"`.
### v. a variable `comp_var` to store `2 + 3i`. 

## b. Use `class()` function to find the data type of the variables created above.
## c. Create another variable `width` to store `12.1` and perform the following operations;

### i. Add variable `length` to width`.
### ii. Subtract `width` from `length`.
### iii. Multiply `length` and `width`. Store the solution in a variable `area`.

## d. Convert each of the created variable in "a" above to raw data type. 


# 2. Create a vector, `my_vector` with the following values; `12, 54, 76, 71, 42, 75, 33` and perform the following operations; 

## a. Find the:
  
### i. dimension of `my_vector` using `dim()` function.
### ii. data type of its element using the `class()` function. 
### iii. Use the `is.vector()` function to find its a vector. 

## b. This part will require you to access and manipulate the vector elements of `my_vector`. 

### i. Get the fourth value of `my_vector`. and print to the console. 
### ii. Subset the vector from the second to the fifth element and print it to the console. 
### iii. Exclude the fourth element and print the resultant vector to the console. 
### iv. Reverse the order elements in `my_vector`. 


# 3. Create two vectors; `vector1` and `vector2`that have the elements `12, 76, 45, 23, 64, 88` and `22, 87, 10, 5, 99, 54` respectively.Use the two vectors to answer the following questions. 

## a. Use `summarise()` function to find the descriptive statistics of`vector1`. 
## b. Add 7 to `vector1` and name it `vector3`.
## c. Subtract 3 from `vector2` and name it `vector4`. 
## d. Add `vector1` to `vector2`
## e. Find the division of the `vector1` and `vector2`.
