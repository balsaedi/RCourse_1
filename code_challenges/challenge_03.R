# LOOPS

# Solve the following equations using `for` and `while` loops;

# 1. A vector `v` contains `34, 86, 23, 65, 98`. Use a `for` loop to print each `v` element. 

# 2. Create a matrix with the first column containing numbers from 1 to 3 and b containing 4 to 6. Use a `for` loop to print each row of the data frame. 

# 3. Vector `x` has elements, `1, 2, 3` while vector `y` consist of elements, `3, 0, -3`. Use nested `for` loops to print all combinations of the elements in `x` and `y`. 

# 4. Create a sequence, `m`, from 1 to 10. Use a `for` loop to print each element, but break the loop if the element is equal to 5.

# 5. A variable `b` initially has a value of 1. Double the value of `b` and print it out to the console. The printing should stop once `b` is greater than or equal to 30. Use a `while` loop for this. 

# 6. A vector `names` contains elements, `Vipin, Patel, Pradip, Salman, Tom`. Iterate through the vector and print `"Hello"` alongside each name to print greet the participant. 
# **Hint**: *Use a for loop*
  
# 7. Create a matrix `m` filled with values from 1 to 12 that has 4 rows and 3 columns. Use a for loop to iterate through each row and find its sum.
# 8. A variable `n` has a value 3. Add 3 to `n` alliteratively and print out the result as long as `n` is equal to or less than 25. Use a `while` loop to solve this problem. 
# 9. A vector `v` contains values from 1 to 7. Using a `for` loop, iterate through each element the use a `while` loop to subtract each element until it reaches 0. Print out the final result after the loops. 
# **Hint**: *Nest a ``while` loop in a `for` loop*.

# 10. Create a vector, `animals` containing `"cat", "lion", "dog", "sheep"`. Use a for loop to print out each element alongside the number of characters the element contains.
