The Labels - Title, X and Y axis labels 3. The Theme - Default, Black and White, coloured etc. 4. The Facets - Individual Graphs for each group in data with exactly same range 5. The Layers or geoms - The actual plot type - e.g Bar plot, Box plot, Violin plot etc. 9.2 Biology behind the data we are using &lt;–Review the slide on minute 3 video 7–&gt; "],["analysis.html", "Chapter 10 Analysis 10.1 Plotting", " Chapter 10 Analysis Invoke the libraries library(ggplot2) library(data.table) Read the data using the fread function methylated_c = fread(&quot;data/R_WORKSHOP.csv&quot;, header=T, sep=&quot;,&quot;) View the data View(methylated_c) Look at the data str(methylated_c) ## Classes &#39;data.table&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 15 obs. of 4 variables: ## $ Chromosome : chr &quot;Chr1&quot; &quot;Chr2&quot; &quot;Chr3&quot; &quot;Chr4&quot; ... ## $ Context : chr &quot;CG&quot; &quot;CG&quot; &quot;CG&quot; &quot;CG&quot; ... ## $ Count : int 1394740 915144 1118062 879170 1260598 1543980 988829 1225767 957674 1377407 ... ## $ Count_in_millions: num 1.395 0.915 1.118 0.879 1.261 ... ## - attr(*, &quot;.internal.selfref&quot;)=&lt;externalptr&gt; calculate the summary statistics summary(methylated_c) ## Chromosome Context Count Count_in_millions ## Length:15 Length:15 Min. : 879170 Min. :0.8792 ## Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.:1053446 1st Qu.:1.0534 ## Mode :character Mode :character Median :1377407 Median :1.3774 ## Mean :2857317 Mean :2.8573 ## 3rd Qu.:5025181 3rd Qu.:5.0252 ## Max. :7917805 Max. :7.9178 Do the data have null values? sum(is.na(methylated_c)) ## [1] 0 class(methylated_c) ## [1] &quot;data.table&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; 10.1 Plotting 10.1.1 Base set up Define the graph skeleton Define the aesthetics Define the labels graph=ggplot(methylated_c, aes(x=Chromosome, y=Count_in_millions))+ #graph aesthetics labs(x=&quot;Chromosomes&quot;, y=&quot;Cytosine count in millions&quot;, title=&quot;C distribution in A thaliana&quot;) #graph labels print(graph) Define the type of graph - geoms graph1 = graph + geom_col() #plot a bar chart print(graph1) Add some depth to the chart - introduce the third variable “Context” Make it a stacked bar chart graph2=graph1+aes(fill=Context) print(graph2) Additional modifications-grouped bar chart graph3=graph+geom_col(position=&quot;dodge&quot;)+aes(fill=Context) print(graph3) Faceting - Group the charts by context Faceted graphs graph4=graph3+facet_grid(~Context) print(graph4) Using predefined colours graph5=graph4+scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;brown&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) print(graph5) Modifying the background colour graph5+theme_bw(base_size=9)+theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill=&quot;lightblue&quot;)) One single step - Combine the above steps into one my_title = expression(paste(&quot;Cystosine distribution in &quot;, italic(&quot;Arabidopis thaliana&quot;)))#Define the title graph_final = ggplot(methylated_c, aes(x=Chromosome, y=Count_in_millions))+ labs(x=&quot;Chromosomes&quot;, title = my_title) + facet_grid(~Context) + geom_col(position=&quot;dodge&quot;)+ aes(fill=Context)+scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;brown&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;))+ theme_bw(base_size = 9)+theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill=&quot;lightblue&quot;)) print(graph_final) The expression is used to combine name italics and normal fonts - this helps biologists include botanical names in charts The graphs can be exported as images or pdf.
