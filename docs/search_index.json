Developed by Statisticians - R is Excellent for Statistical Computing and Analysis Open-source (Free) - R is an open-source programming language. Anyone can work with R without any license or fee. Due to this, R has a huge community that contributes to its environment. A Large Variety of Specialized Libraries - These libraries support and enhance the R development environment. R Studio - A graphic user interface to R - easier to grasp and learn. Cross-platform Support - R is machine-independent. It supports the cross-platform operation. Thus, it is usable on many different operating systems. Can do Data Cleansing, Data Wrangling, and Web Scraping - R can collect data from the internet through web scraping and other means. It can also perform data cleansing. R is also useful for data wrangling which is the process of converting raw data into the desired format for easier consumption. Powerful Graphics - R has extensive libraries that can produce production quality graphs and visualizations. Compatible with other Programming Languages - R is compatible with other languages like C, C++, and FORTRAN. Other languages like .NET, Java, Python can also directly manipulate objects. Compatible with high performance computing and Big Data Analytics. 1.3 R studio Rstudio is an integrated development environment(IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution as well as tools for plotting history, debugging and work space management.

Different types of data structures in R include; - Vector - Matrix - Data frame 2.2.1 Vector A vector is a single entity consisting of a collection of things. Here is an example of a vector. marks = c(23, 67, 98, 34, 98, 21) print(marks) ## [1] 23 67 98 34 98 21 The class function is utilized to determine the data types present within vector data values. class(marks) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; The vector “marks” consist of only numeric values is.vector function is used to check if the variable is a vector is.vector(marks) ## [1] TRUE unlike matrix and data frame, vector has no dimension dim(marks) ## NULL length() function is used to count number of elements in vectors length(marks) ## [1] 6 Index is the position of an element in a vector, in R it starts at index 1 - lets say we find the third element by index 3 marks[3] ## [1] 98 value “98” is at index 3, or the third in the vector.
